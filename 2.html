        <h2>Gerd Muiller</h2>
        <p><strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerd_M%C3%BCller" target="_blank" title="Gerd Muller - Wikipedia">Gerd Muller</a></u></strong> was a German professional footballer. A striker renowned for his clinical finishing, especially in and around the six-yard box, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest goalscorers in the history of the sport.</p>
        <img src="Gerd_Müller_c1973.jpg" width="350">
        <p style="margin-top:30px;">With success at club and international level, he is one of nine players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d'Or.
        At international level with West Germany, he scored 68 goals in 62 appearances, and at club level, in 15 years with Bayern Munich in which he scored 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga matches, he became – and still is – record holder of that league. In 74 European club games he scored 65 goals. Averaging over a goal a game with West Germany, Müller was, as of 11 July 2021, 21st on the list of all time international goalscorers, despite playing fewer matches than every other player in the top 48. Among the top scorers, he has the third-highest goal-to-game ratio. He also had the highest ratio of 0.97 goals per game in the European Cup, scoring 34 goals in 35 matches.</p>
